This project makes use of several api keys, each of which is stored in a .env file that isn't pushed to GitHub for security reasons. You can register for keys by using the following links. 
[Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/register)
[Google Places API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?_ga=2.33032574.1722274875.1559603342-1851123871.1552525580#get-started)

2. Clone your fork with `git clone [code-you-copied-from-clone-button]`
3. `cd pickup` to make sure you are in the right directory
4. Add an `upstream` remote for keeping your local repo up-to-date:

5. Run `git fetch upstream master` to check for updates in the upstream remote repo
6. Run `git log --oneline --graph --all` to see the changes added to `upstream/master`

  7.1 Make sure you are in the right branch to make the merge: `git checkout master`<br/>
  7.2 Merge to the changes added by the maintainer: `git merge upstream/master`
  7.3 Push the forked repo to update: `git push origin master`
8. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
9. In the root directory, create a new file called `.env`
10. Copy the variables from `.env.sample` into your .env file and update with your keys
